Outline:

1. Overview of SARS-CoV-2 evolution up to this point
 - Emergence and spread of variant viruses during 2021 due primarily to mutations to spike protein that increase transmissibility culminating in Delta’s displacement of competing diversity
 - Emergence and rapid spread of Omicron emphasizing large spike divergence and large degree of immune escape (~10% VE against symptomatic infection in fully vaccinated)
 - Briefly cover Omicron origin hypotheses
2. Comparison to influenza and seasonal CoV evolution, emphasizing the rapidity of what we’ve seen so far with SARS-CoV-2 relative to flu
 - Focus just on amino acid rate
3. Discussion of immediate trends as existing genetic diversity plays out
 - We’ll see displacement of BA.1 by BA.2 over the coming ~8 weeks
 - Still potential for return of Delta viruses, which should become clear in ~April
4. Discussion of two "paths" for SARS-CoV-2 evolution going forward, where we can expect to see:
 - Continual refinements of transmissibility and continual push for small antigenic changes within BA.2
 - Potential for large leaps with further “Omicron-like” saltational emergence events
 - Given ~2 years of pandemic and observation of 1 Omicron-like event we can bracket rate of emergence, but there is substantial uncertainty
 - ie we don’t know if Omicron was a one-off event or if these jumps will be feature of SARS-CoV-2 evolution going forward
5. Likely scenarios over the next ~12 months
 - Connect scenarios to levels of circulation

	<h3>Omicron attack rate</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			We estimate US has seen 4.5% of the population as confirmed cases of Omicron through Jan 17, with the
			large majority accumulating after Dec 15
		</li>
		<li>
			Assuming a case detection rate of 1 in 5 infections, we have ~22.5% of the US having been infected with Omicron
		</li>
		<li>
			We're about at the peak now, assuming the same number of cases on the other side of the peak would give ~45% of the US
			infected by Omicron in the span of just over 2 months.

<!-- Expectations for endemicity -->

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Broad expectations based on comparison with flu</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of Delta/Omicron is perhaps ~6 compared to
			<i>R</i><sub class="even-smaller">0</sub> of flu of ~2. At same rates of evolution and waning
			expect more COVID circulation.
		</li>
		<li>
			Before Omicron rates of evolution in SARS-CoV-2 S1 had been roughly equal to H3N2 flu.
			Omicron equivalent to 6 years of H3N2 evolution.
		</li>
		<li>
			IFR of COVID is roughly comparable to flu once you have prior immunity.
		</li>
	</ol>
	</p>
	<p>
		1, 2 and 3 suggest a virus that circulates at higher levels than flu, but individual
		infections aren't much more severe in terms of mortality than H3N2 influenza.
	</p>
	<p>
		Seasonality suggests winter "COVID season", but Omicron-like events could overcome seasonality.
	</p>
</section>

<section class="left-align">
	<h3>Key parameters are seasonal attack rate and IFR</h3>
	<p>
	<ol>
		<li>
			Assume seasonal attack rates of 20-30% in most years, and Omicron-like 50% in others.
		</li>
		<li>
			Assume IFR of 0.05% (compared to early pandemic IFR of 0.5%).
		</li>
		<li>
			This would give perhaps 30-50K deaths most seasons, and Omicron-like seasons with ~80K deaths in the US (but potential for IFR of 0.1% to double this).
		</li>
	</ol>
